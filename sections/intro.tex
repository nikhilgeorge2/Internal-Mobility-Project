\section{Introduction}


Major corporations like Google, Walmart, and IBM, along with other public and private agencies, have committed to 
skills-based hiring policies, focusing on capabilities rather than traditional credentials such as degrees or work 
experience \citep{hbr2022skillsbased, mckinsey2020future, wef2020jobs}. This shift comes at a time when employees 
increasingly pursue less fixed career paths both within and across firms, and when the skills required to perform 
modern work evolve rapidly. These forces compel firms to articulate skill requirements and job responsibilities 
with greater precision in their postings. This information is not only consumed by potential applicantsâ€”it is 
embedded in the algorithms used by platforms like Indeed and LinkedIn to curate and match opportunities to 
candidates, and ingested by sophisticated screening tools that shortlist applicant resumes based on fit against 
these requirements. Job postings and their content are also systematically harvested by specialized firms like 
Revelio and Lightcast, who package this data into analytical products that provide insights into workforce skill 
requirements across industries\footnote{The workforce analytics provided by firms like Revelio and Lightcast have 
not only supported businesses but also spurred a growing body of academic research that study trends in skill 
demands and job creation \citep{goldfarb2020artificial, azar2020concentration}, and other critical labor market 
phenomena \citep{hershbein2018recessions, forsythe2020labor, braxton2023technological}.}. These developments 
underscore the growing importance of job postings as a key source of valuable information at the analytical, 
strategic, and policy levels.

Despite this growing centrality of job posting content and significant investment in its analysis, no rigorous validation 
exists of whether posting-derived skill measures predict actual selection and mobility outcomes. While firms are 
investing in more detailed skill descriptions, and sophisticated tools are being built to extract and analyze this content, 
consumers of posting-based analytics and tools operate without clear evidence of informativeness. Legitimate concerns 
exist - postings might be aspirational rather than realistic, could be template-driven or overly generic, and might 
list ``nice to have" skills rather than true requirements. Understanding how informative these postings are for 
measuring skill requirements is crucial for the growing ecosystem of tools and analytics being built on this content. 
The ability to validate posting-derived measures against selection decisions would inform both current applications 
and future innovations.

We partner with the IT division of a major financial services firm to study the informativeness of job postings by 
linking it to actual workers and their mobility process. This setting provides an ideal laboratory - the firm's 
hiring process generates detailed position requirements through job postings, which multiple internal candidates 
consider and apply to. The firm's internal job board offers comprehensive records of both successful and unsuccessful 
applications over multiple years. Crucially, we can link the applicants to the postings of their current job and 
observe both successful and unsuccessful applications, providing the opportunity to assess the informative content 
in job postings to predict selection. By structuring a prediction problem, we can examine whether the skill 
distances derived from posting content meaningfully predict selection outcomes, thereby contributing a first of 
its kind estimate of the nature and level of informativeness in job postings; an information source of increasing 
application inside and outside the firm.

Our analysis reveals substantial predictive power in posting-derived skill measures. The probability of selection 
decreases by 84\% when comparing applications in the lowest versus highest quintile of skill distance, indicating 
posting content captures meaningful differences in worker-job fit. This predictive power is particularly evident 
when examining vacancies with multiple applicants - in 70\% of these cases, the candidate with the shortest skill 
distance was selected. The predictive relationship holds both across vacancies and within applicants (across their 
different applications). Notably, traditional employee characteristics like age, tenure, and work experience 
contribute minimally beyond the skill distance measure - suggesting the rich information in job postings dominates 
standard observable characteristics in explaining selection outcomes.

The first step in our machine learning pipeline converts the key information in a job posting to a job skill-embedding 
by mapping it in the language space of a pre-trained language model. While these embeddings capture rich semantic 
relationships in general language, our context of technical skills and responsibilities likely lies in a much 
lower dimensional space. Moreover, with relatively few selection decisions compared to the embedding dimensions, 
we need dimension reduction to enable effective learning of the distance metric. The distance metric learning, 
akin to fine-tuning the general language model's notion of similarity for our specific context, reveals meaningful 
skill relationships. This learned representation's validity is demonstrated through its strong predictive power on 
held-out selection decisions, and its application reveals novel patterns in how employees navigate opportunities 
based on skill-fit.

We apply the skill distance measure to investigate internal job application patterns, revealing another dimension of 
job posting informativeness. Those whose skills closely match available vacancies adopt a relatively passive approach 
despite higher chances of success, while employees facing larger skill distances actively pursue positions requiring 
skill development. By structuring standard posting and mobility data, we show how posting-derived analytics can generate 
actionable insights about whether reducing search frictions or investing in skill development should be prioritized. 
Such capabilities suggest a promising direction for HR analytics, a field that has seen limited advancement despite 
significant interest \citep{Tambe2019} - the combination of skill information in job postings and mobility patterns 
enables rich workforce analytics. Our analysis reveals novel patterns about internal mobility, providing evidence 
about job search behavior in an environment characterized by employed workers navigating evolving skill requirements 
- a setting distinct from traditional unemployment-focused search models. This ability to measure skill requirements 
from job postings and track mobility decisions opens new possibilities for personnel economics research to 
systematically investigate career navigation and skill development choices.

Our paper illuminates the informative content in job postings by linking their skill and responsibility descriptions 
to selection outcomes and application decisions. Through selection prediction, we provide first validation that 
posting-derived skill measures capture meaningful differences in worker-job fit - a crucial validation given the 
growing use of posting content in platforms, analytics, and research. Through our inquiry into application patterns, 
we illuminate how this posting information relates to mobility behavior. This analysis demonstrates significant 
potential for firms to gain insights about internal mobility and its relationship to skill-fit by leveraging 
posting information, while opening new research possibilities in understanding how employees navigate careers 
in environments characterized by evolving skill requirements.

To summarize, this paper illuminates how findings validate a fundamental data source driving major market decisions 
while demonstrating rich analytical possibilities. By showing posting content contains meaningful skill information 
that predicts outcomes, we inform the growing ecosystem of screening tools and analytics built on this content. The 
results challenge pessimism about HR analytics by showing how posting information can guide specific 
interventions - from reducing search frictions for well-matched workers to targeting skill development where needed. 
This posting-based approach outperforms traditional collaborative filtering methods by leveraging the rich content 
in job descriptions, opening new avenues for research in labor economics and personnel practices.

\subsection{Literature Review}

Our work advances a rich technical literature on job recommendation, worker-job matching, and skill 
representation learning---supporting platforms that facilitate job search, candidate-opening matching, and 
career trajectory modeling\footnote{The technical literature has included work on recommender systems 
\citep{shaha2012survey,siting2012job} and representation learning \citep{heap2014combining, zhu2018person, 
liu2019tripartite, bian2020learning} to support platforms facilitating job search 
\citep{heap2014combining,giabelli2021skills2job}, matching jobs to candidates \citep{zhu2018person,qin2020enhanced} 
and modeling career paths and skill recommendations \citep{maurya2017bayesian, kokkodis2021demand}.}. While these 
advances demonstrate sophisticated ways to process job posting content, their focus on platform functionality leaves 
open the fundamental question of whether derived skill measures predict actual selection outcomes. Our work provides 
the first systematic validation of these measures through observed selection decisions.

Our research contributes directly to the Information Systems literature studying algorithms that match workers to 
jobs and recommend skill development \citep{kokkodis2021demand, kokkodis2023good}, while addressing fundamental 
questions about assessing the value of data for algorithmic applications \citep{lei2024value}. Particularly relevant 
is \citet{raghavan2020mitigating}'s documentation of limited transparency in automated screening systems. By 
demonstrating that posting-derived skill measures strongly predict selection, we provide both validation of these 
measures and a framework for evaluating hiring algorithms in practice.

Our work enriches the study of internal labor markets, where different approaches to measuring employee-position 
fit have emerged. \citet{devos2024data} develops recommender systems using collaborative filtering based on observed 
transitions and employee features, while \citet{2024_Cowgill} examines team assignment mechanisms using survey-based 
skill scores validated by management. We demonstrate how the rich skill information contained in job postings can 
generate validated measures of fit that complement these approaches, requiring neither extensive mobility histories 
nor expert validation.

We provide crucial validation for a growing literature in management and economics that leverages job posting text 
to study labor market dynamics. Researchers have extracted signals from job descriptions to examine wage premia 
\citep{Bana2021}, analyze technology's impact on skill demands \citep{George2024}, and forecast effects of 
generative AI \citep{eloundou2024gpts, 2024_Acemoglu}. Our demonstration that posting-derived skill measures 
strongly predict selection outcomes provides important validation for this literature's growing use of posting 
text to measure skill requirements.

Our analysis advances research on career moves and incentives in personnel economics, where studies have documented 
patterns in internal moves \citep{bidwell2024stepping} and efficiency gains from internal hiring \citep{bidwell2011paying}. 
This literature spans from early work on career incentives \citep{baker1994internal, baker1994wage} to recent studies 
of internal labor markets \citep{tambe2020paying, huitfeldt2023internal}. By validating posting-derived skill measures 
and showing how they predict both selection and application patterns, we provide new tools for studying modern career 
navigation in environments where skill requirements evolve rapidly.

We proceed as follows: In Section \ref{sec:research_setting}, we describe the research setting, the 
firm, data and the internal mobility process. In Section \ref{sec:objective_approach}, we outline 
the conceptual ideas of the prediction problem. Section \ref{sec:machine_learning_pipeline} presents 
the machine learning pipeline, the algorithms and details of data processing and implementation. In 
Section \ref{sec:evaluation_skill_distance}, we evaluate the effectiveness of the skill distance metric 
in predicting selection outcomes in detail. In Section \ref{sec:internal_mobility_patterns} we apply 
the distance measure to new positions to study application intensity to new positions vary with skill 
fit and concluding in Section \ref{sec:conclusion_discussion}.
