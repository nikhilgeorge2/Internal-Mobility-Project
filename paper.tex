\maketitle

Information in job postings plays an increasingly central role in modern labor markets; aside from information for 
potential employees the content in them is a key part of matching algorithms, screening tools, and broader workforce 
analytics. This brings up the demand to ascertain how the measures of skills and job requirements built from job postings 
predict actual selection outcomes. We provide a first validation of the informativeness by predicting selection to internal 
jobs at a major firm from a measure of skill distance built on job postings. Skill distances built on job postings 
strongly predict selection - the probability of selection is 84\% higher when the sought job is in the lowest quintile 
of skill distance compared to a position in the highest distance quintile. And in 70\% of cases the selected candidate 
is the one with the shortest skill distance. These skill measures consistently outperform traditional employee 
characteristics in explaining selection. We build on this validation to show how internal application intensity is 
strongly correlated with average skill distance to emerging opportunities - novel insights relevant to human capital 
management and research on employee mobility in modern labor markets. Beyond validating posting informativeness through 
selection outcomes, our analysis reveals rich possibilities for research and analytics leveraging the skill content 
in job postings.
